### üìù Tasks Completed

The virtual experience program was divided into several key tasks, each simulating a real-world scenario.

**1. Designing a Believable Phishing Page**
- **Objective:** To understand attacker techniques by improving an existing phishing email and designing a more effective phishing page.
- **Process:** I analyzed a poorly made phishing attempt and identified its weaknesses. I then applied principles of social engineering‚Äîcreating a sense of legitimacy, professional tone, and urgency‚Äîto design a more believable phishing email and landing page template.
- **Outcome:** Successfully created a design for a convincing phishing page, demonstrating a strong understanding of attacker Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) from an offensive perspective.

**2. Phishing Awareness Campaign**
- **Objective:** To improve security awareness for teams identified as being most susceptible to phishing attacks.
- **Process:** Analyzed the results of a simulated phishing campaign to understand common weaknesses. Developed a concise and engaging 3-slide training presentation to educate employees on what phishing is, how to spot common tactics, and how to report suspicious emails.
- **Outcome:** Created a professional training presentation suitable for a corporate audience, showcasing skills in threat analysis and security communication.

**3. Reviewing Employee Access Controls**
- **Objective:** To review and recommend changes to employee access rights based on the principle of least privilege.
- **Process:** Assessed a list of employees, their roles, and their current access levels to different systems. Identified instances of excessive permissions that could pose a security risk.
- **Outcome:** Provided recommendations to remediate unnecessary access, demonstrating an understanding of core security principles like access control management.
